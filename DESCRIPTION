Description: CreateFlowChart takes as input a dataset where a list of exclusion criteria is represented as binary or boolean variables.
  The output are two datasets (a)	the input dataset itself, restricted to the sole rows which don't match any exclusion criterion;
  this dataset is returned at the end of the function, and (b) the flowchart representing how many units were discarded by each criterion;
  this dataset is saved in the R environment. Criteria are considered to be hierarchical.
  As an option, the count is performed across strata of a categorical variable.
